# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🛡️💳

This project implements a machine learning-based model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning algorithms.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a major concern in financial systems. This project aims to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine using historical transaction data.

## 🧠 Model

- Preprocessing with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Trained using:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
